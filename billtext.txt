9

the meaning of section 305(b)) for certifications of

plan status completed before January 1, 2021, un-

11

less such assumptions are clearly erroneous. For cer-

tifications of plan status completed after December

13

31, 2020, a plan shall determine whether it is in

14

critical or critical and declining status for purposes

15

of eligibility for special financial assistance by using

16

the assumptions that the plan used in its most re-

17

cently completed certification of plan status before

January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions (exclud-

ing the plan’s interest rate) are unreasonable.

6

cently completed certification of plan status be-

7

fore January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions

8

are unreasonable.

‘‘(3) INTEREST

RATE LIMIT.—The

limit for purposes of this subsection is the rate spec-

‘‘(4) CHANGES

IN ASSUMPTIONS.—If

a plan de-

18

19

is unreasonable, the plan may propose in its applica-

20

21

plan discloses such changes in its application and

22

describes why such assumptions are no longer rea-

sonable. The corporation shall accept such changed

unreasonable, individually or in the aggregate. The
